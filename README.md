# Signature-based and Image-based Malware Detection Systems

This project explores the integration of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) with signature-based and image-based malware detection systems.

## Objectives:

- Gain hands-on experience with building and deploying machine learning models for cybersecurity.
- Understand the importance of MLOps in managing the development lifecycle of ML models.
- Evaluate the performance of various machine learning models for malware detection using both image and signature data.

## Getting Started:

**1. Clone this repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/firdaous-boulben/malware-detection.git
```

**2. Set up the environment:**
This project uses Python libraries like `OpenCV`, `scikit-learn`, and requires tools like `docker`, `kubernetes`, and `FastAPI`.  Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for specific dependencies and installation instructions.

**3. Data Acquisition:**
The project expects datasets containing both image and signature information for malware samples. You can find these from the links below:
 - [Signatures Dataset](https://github.com/chihebchebbi/Mastering-Machine-Learning-for-Penetration-Testing/blob/master/Chapter03/MalwareData.csv.gz)
 - [Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravpendharkar/blended-malware-image-dataset)

## Project Workflow:

- **Data Preprocessing:**
Preprocess the acquired data to standardize their format, handle missing values, and extract relevant features for model training.
- **Model Selection:**
Train various machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM)
- **Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **MLOps Integration:**
Implement MLOps practices throughout the workflow like Git version control, CI/CD pipelines for automation, experiment tracking, model versioning, and containerization with orchestration for a streamlined, reproducible, and scalable development lifecycle.
- **Model Deployment:**
Deploy the best performing model (Random Forest) using containerization and orchestration techniques.

## Key Technologies Used:

- **Scikit-learn:**
A popular Python machine learning library used for training and evaluating malware detection models.
- **OpenCV:**
A powerful image processing library used for manipulating and analyzing malware image data.
- **Docker:**
A containerization platform used to package, distribute, and run applications in isolated containers.
- **Kubernetes:**
An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
- **Flask:**
A lightweight web framework for building web applications and APIs in Python. Used to create API services for the malware detection application.
- **Angular:**
A popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic and feature-rich web applications. Used to develop the user interface for the malware detection system.
- **Tailwind CSS:**
A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive user interfaces. Used to create a stylish and user-friendly UI for the application.
- **GitHub:**
A Git-based software development platform used for source code hosting, version control, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Facilitates collaboration and automates the development process.
